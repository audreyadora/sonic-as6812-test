ToDo:

1. Use standard log library for logging
2. Better to use standard thrift serialize/unserialize logic instead of cmd class
3. The user of the arp responder should periodically rerequest mac addresses for IP's to update them
4. arpresponder has a leaked abstraction from cmd
5. Somewhere struct type, somewhere just type
6. use this-> or omit it
7. member_variable_ ?
8. exceptions
